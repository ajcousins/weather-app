# weather-app

A simple weather application which calls on the openweathermap.org API for data covering the next 7 days. I took this opportunity to learn about CSS transitions, animations and SVGs which I think work particularly well for this app. The design inspiration is from the weather graphic shown at the end of the BBC weather forecast.
